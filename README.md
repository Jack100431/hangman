# hangman
This is a basic version of the game Hangman, which I created with Python code. I am a Python learner, so I hope everyone can use it as an example, or improve it. Thank you!
Hangman is a famous game, and it is played as a cartoon character hanging on a tree if the player guesses wrong. My friend Jeff Jiajun Li highly suggested I build this game with Python, the CS language I learned. Therefore it came out in a file named hangman.py, which is below this README.
I hope this code is useful for every new learner of Python, and I also expect some comments to improve! Thank you!
